<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Laetitia ("Georgia" for friends)</h1>
<h3 align="center">A software developer, former HR (yes, that's possible :muscle:)</h3>

‚ö° Fun fact : **My nickname is Georgia because of one of my character in a role playing game**

<h3 align="left">Experience</h3>

I'm java developer for 4 years, i'm working mostly with **Java** and **Spring** <a href="https://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" alt="java" width="30" height="30"/> </a>
<a href="https://spring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/springio/springio-icon.svg" alt="spring" width="30" height="30"/> </a> <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/git-scm/git-scm-icon.svg" alt="git" width="30" height="30"/> </a> <a href="https://postman.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/getpostman/getpostman-icon.svg" alt="postman" width="30" height="30"/> </a>

I worked for energy sector and automotive sector. My job was to develop java interfaces between 2 of their softwares to migrate data from one software to another.

<h3 align="left">Goals</h3>

I'm interested in **climate changeüå≥, zero waste üöÆ, animal rightsüê∂, green IT :computer:** and I'd love to find a job with a green objective.

Technically, I'd love to develop skills in **CI/CD** <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/docker/docker-original.svg" alt="docker" width="30" height="30"/></a> or **Cloud** like AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/amazonwebservices/amazonwebservices-original-wordmark.svg" alt="aws" width="30" height="30"/> </a> to have a larger view on global IT architecture and not just development. </br> I'm not really a front-end lover, I'm using mostly **Boostrap** or **Bulma** to avoid CSS as much as possible but I try to learn on my own **Vue.js** <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vuejs/vuejs-original.svg" alt="vue" width="25" height="25"/></a> when I have some time (not much to be honest).

<h3 align="left">Projects</h3>

I have created a [Github Pages](https://georgialr.github.io/) to share some knowledge and capitalize my own progression. I chose to use french language for this project because it's more a personal thing.

I'll share the other ones with you soon.

<h3 align="left">Readings</h3>

Do you know daily.dev ? It's a chrome extension where you can find a lot of tech articles.
